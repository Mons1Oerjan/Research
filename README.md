Worked as part of a software engineering team to create a researcher mobile Web Application in Java and Vaadin 
to track students on campus on a map. We used agile (XP) and test-driven development during the development process.

List of technologies that were used in this project:
- Vaadin 7.6.4 API
- Server: Apache Tomcat 7.0
- SVN integrated with Eclipse
- JPA database, hibernate, persistence and BeanValidation
- JavaDoc
- Customized widgetset
- Login validator library
- Test-driven development and unit-tests written with JUnit
- Continuous integration with Ant
- Vaadin Testbench for writing unit-tests on UI-content
- Vaadin Touchkit Addon (for mobile purposes)
- Vaadin Leaflet Addon (for map purposes)

We divided this project into three 3-week iterations that consisted of:
- User stories
- Acceptance tests 
- Task breakdown
- burn-up-, velocity- and test results-charts
- Continuous Integration JUnit outputs from building with Ant upon every SVN commit
- Meeting minutes
- Post-mortems
